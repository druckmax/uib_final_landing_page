## Concept:
The concept is to build a simple homepage for a fictional recording studio, which specializes in vintage gear and recording techniques. To convey the feeling of nostalgia, the design focuses on gritty overlay textures and animated figures, taken from 1950s style ads.

A high focus lies on the responsiveness of the website. The website purely relies on CSS, compiled from SCSS.

## Want to do:
1. Fixing performance issues
2. Adding hamburger menu to the navbar with CSS popup
3. Adding Google maps iframe
4. Adding Impressum
5. More artists on bigger screen sizes
6. Flipping artists card with front and backside (only CSS)
7. Contact modal opening when header button is clicked (only CSS)
